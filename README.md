How to Survive in Polytechnique Montreal
Please rate the repository if it's been of any help to you.
Also, if this has been of any help to you, repeat the gesture by sending ANYTHING you deem useful for ANY program (homework, TD, TP, Exams, etc) to qwertydaswertrew@gmail.com and it will be added to this repo and hopefully help more of the community !
More stuff will be added to this repo through the semesters and hopefully, at one point, someone could have good material for every class when starting his program at Polymtl.

ONCE AGAIN, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE TO THIS REPO IF IT'S BEEN OF ANY HELP TO YOU IF YOU WANT TO HAVE IT UPDATED IN THE FUTURE.
